    "The previous project successfully demonstrated how class balancing and feature transformations impact model performance. These same principles are applied in the current research, but with a broader focus on automating preprocessing techniques for diverse datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Balancing** (SMOTE & Undersampling): In the wine quality dataset, balancing improved model accuracy by ensuring all classes were well represented. Similarly, in the current research, we apply controlled oversampling and undersampling to create a more robust classification pipeline.\n",

    "- **Skewness Correction**: The previous project applied log transformations to normalize distributions, preventing biases. Here, we expand this with Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformations, adapting preprocessing to different data types.\n",

    "- **Model Optimization**: In the last project, hyperparameter tuning boosted performance dramatically. We extend this by optimizing classification thresholds and cost-sensitive learning to handle imbalanced datasets more effectively."

    "   #### Applying Data Transformations\n",

    "## **Step 2: Addressing Class Imbalance in Machine Learning**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Class imbalance is a common challenge in datasets where one class is significantly underrepresented compared to another. This issue is especially critical in **fraud detection, medical diagnostics, and rare event classification**, where models tend to favor the majority class, leading to poor detection of minority cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this, we implement a **balanced approach** that enhances model performance while preserving real-world data characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ **TF-IDF Transformation:** Converts textual data into numerical features, ensuring text-based patterns contribute effectively to classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✔ **Moderate SMOTE Oversampling:** Expands the minority class to **10% of the majority class size**, improving its representation without overfitting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✔ **Strategic Undersampling:** Reduces the majority class to **twice the size of the minority class**, but only in the **training set**, as recommended by research for optimal generalization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✔ **Maintaining Real-World Distribution in the Test Set:** The test set remains **unaltered** to reflect actual class proportions, ensuring the model is evaluated under realistic conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By combining **oversampling, undersampling, and TF-IDF transformation**, we create a **well-balanced training dataset** that allows the model to learn from **minority cases** without introducing bias towards artificially inflated data. "

    "### 2.1 Apply TF-IDF for Text Processing\n",
    "**Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** is a statistical measure employed to evaluate the importance of a word within a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval to transform textual data into numerical representations, facilitating the analysis and modeling of text by machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components of TF-IDF:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Term Frequency (TF):** This component quantifies the frequency of a term in a specific document. It reflects how often a word appears in a document, indicating its relevance within that particular context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** This component assesses the significance of a term across the entire corpus. It diminishes the weight of terms that occur frequently across many documents and increases the weight of terms that are rare, thereby highlighting words that are more informative and less generic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation of TF-IDF:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The TF-IDF value for a term in a document is calculated by multiplying its TF and IDF values:\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "- t represents the term;\n",
    "- d denotes the specific document;\n",
    "- D signifies the entire corpus of documents.\n",

    "**Applications of TF-IDF:**\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is instrumental in various NLP tasks, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Classification:** By converting text into numerical features, TF-IDF enables machine learning models to classify documents based on their content.\n",

    "- **Information Retrieval:** Search engines utilize TF-IDF to rank documents by relevance to a user's query, ensuring more pertinent results are presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clustering and Topic Modeling:** TF-IDF aids in grouping similar documents and identifying underlying themes by emphasizing significant terms within the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of class imbalance, particularly in domains like fraud detection or rare event classification, TF-IDF plays a crucial role. By assigning appropriate weights to terms, it ensures that minority class characteristics are adequately represented, thereby enhancing the model's ability to detect and learn from underrepresented instances.\n",

    "- **SMOTE and ADASYN provide the best performance** on imbalanced Twitter datasets.\n",
    "- **SVM with linear kernel showed the highest accuracy (99.67%) on ADASYN-generated data**.\n",

    "- **Recommended Approach:** If working with text data, use **TF-IDF** for feature extraction before applying SMOTE.\n",

    "- We oversample any class that has fewer than oversample_target * (size of largest class). For instance, if the largest class has 1000 samples and oversample_target=0.6, then any class with <600 samples will be increased (via SMOTE) up to roughly 600. This parameter is flexible – setting it to 1.0 would fully balance to the majority class size, while a lower value avoids excessive synthetic data.\n",
    "- After oversampling, we undersample any class that now has more than undersample_factor * (size of smallest class). For example, with undersample_factor=1.5, if the smallest class has 600 samples, no other class will be allowed more than 900; the majority class (if larger) is randomly down-sampled to 900. This prevents any class from still dominating the dataset.\n",
    "- Both oversample_target and undersample_factor can be tuned per dataset. For datasets with extreme imbalance, you might oversample to 100% and undersample to equal counts; for milder cases, smaller adjustments may suffice.\n",
    "- We use SMOTE and RandomUnderSampler from imblearn, but you could plug in different oversampling or undersampling methods if needed (the function could accept a different sampler object via parameters).\n",

    "- For each method that succeeds, we compute the absolute skew of the transformed data. The function selects the transformation that yields the lowest skew (i.e., most symmetric distribution). If none of the transforms improve the skew (which is rare), it will return the original data (best_method remains 'none').\n",
    "- Flexible Parameters: You can choose which methods to try via the methods tuple. For example, on a dataset that has only positive values, you might include 'boxcox'; for a dataset with zeros/negatives, use 'yeo-johnson' or 'log'. You can also enable plot=True to visualize the effect for any feature.\n",
    "T- his function handles any numeric feature series. In practice, you would apply it to each numeric column in your dataset that exhibits high skewness (for example, if abs(skew) > 1 as a rule of thumb). You might loop over all numeric features of X and replace those that are significantly skewed with their transformed version. For instance:"
