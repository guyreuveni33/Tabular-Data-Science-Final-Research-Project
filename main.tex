\begin{abstract}
% (Up to 200 words)
In real-world data, many datasets contain skewed numeric features and imbalanced class distributions. This often degrades the performance of machine-learning models, especially in classification tasks. In this project, we propose a pipeline that automatically (1) detects and transforms skewed numerical features to approximate normal distributions and (2) addresses class imbalances in the target variable through synthetic oversampling. Our approach uses statistical tests for skewness, a suite of transformation techniques (e.g., log, Yeo-Johnson), and a method for imbalanced data (e.g., SMOTE/ADASYN). Through experiments on four public datasets (Medical Appointment No-Show, Telco Customer Churn, Lending Club Loan, and Bank Marketing), we compare our pipeline against a baseline without these automated steps. Results show significant improvements in F1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy, especially for minority classes. We conclude that automated skewness correction and class balancing can bring measurable benefits and accelerate data science workflows.
\end{abstract}

\section{Problem Description}
Real-world datasets often suffer from two data-quality issues:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Skewed numerical features}:
    Features with right or left skew (i.e., not symmetric) can bias machine learning models. Their large outliers or tail distributions can be problematic for many algorithms, such as linear models.
    \item \textbf{Imbalanced class distributions}:
    When the target class is imbalanced (e.g., minority classes are rare), models can become biased towards majority classes, ignoring minority classes that are often more important in practice (e.g., fraud detection, churn, etc.).
\end{enumerate}

Historically, manually detecting these issues and then deciding how to fix them (e.g., transformations for skew, oversampling for imbalance) can be time-consuming. Data scientists must also choose from many possible transformations. Hence, an \textit{automated} system to detect and solve skewness and class imbalance can streamline the process.

\section{Solution Overview}
Our proposed pipeline addresses the above challenges through two main components:

\subsection{Automated Skewness Detection and Transformation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Detection of Skew:} Use the sample skewness measure or normality tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk) to determine if a numeric feature is heavily skewed.
    \item \textbf{Transformation:} Apply transformations such as log, square root, Yeo-Johnson, or Box-Cox when appropriate.
    \item \textbf{Selection Logic:} Among transformations, automatically choose the one yielding a distribution closest to normal (based on e.g., Shapiro-Wilk p-value or absolute skewness).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Handling of Class Imbalance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Detection:} Inspect the target column to see if any class distribution is below a certain threshold (e.g., 5-10\%).
    \item \textbf{Balancing Approach:} For minority classes, we apply oversampling methods such as SMOTE or ADASYN, or a combination.
    \item \textbf{Comparisons:} We compare baseline performance (no balancing) with the proposed approach.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\subsection{Datasets}
We use four real-world datasets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Medical Appointment No-Show} \cite{noshowlink}: Contains patient appointment records with features like age, scholarship, hypertension, etc., plus whether the patient showed up. The \textit{no-show} class is smaller.
    \item \textbf{Telco Customer Churn} \cite{telcolink}: Customer data from a telecom service, with a minority class being \textit{churn=Yes}.
    \item \textbf{Lending Club Loan Data} \cite{lendinglink}: Loan data with binary target \textit{loan status}. Default cases are minority classes.
    \item \textbf{Bank Marketing} \cite{bankmarketinglink}: Data from direct marketing campaigns with whether a client subscribed a term deposit (minority class).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proposed Pipeline vs. Baseline}
We compare:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Baseline:} Raw dataset, no skew transformations, no balancing.
    \item \textbf{Proposed:} Automatic detection + transformation (log or Yeo-Johnson) for skewed features, then oversampling (SMOTE or ADASYN) for minority classes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Training and Metrics}
We use two popular classifiers (Random Forest and Logistic Regression) for each dataset. We split data (e.g., 70\% training, 30\% test). Then we measure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accuracy
    \item Precision, Recall, F1-score
    \item Possibly AUC if relevant
\end{itemize}
We also present confusion matrices. Our results show that \textbf{our automated pipeline outperforms the baseline} significantly in terms of minority class recall and F1.

\subsection{Results}
Table~\ref{tab:results} shows a summary of results (F1-scores) across the four datasets. We see that automatically transforming skewed features yields improvements, and class imbalance handling further improves minority class metrics.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}
Our project is connected to prior work on automating data preprocessing and on class imbalance solutions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Automated Approach for Binary Classification on Imbalanced Data} \cite{AutomatedImbal}:
    Introduces an automated framework for handling imbalanced data using various resampling and meta-feature extraction approaches, recommending top candidate solutions. Our method similarly automates transformations and uses standard oversampling.
    \item \textbf{Data Augmentation for Low-Data Imbalanced-Class Regime} \cite{sigaugment}:
    This research provides a signal-based approach for augmenting minority classes effectively. While focusing on signals, it also shows the impact of oversampling and transformations.
    \item \textbf{Efficient Data Augmentation for Classification} \cite{article3}:
    Emphasizes robust augmentation strategies for minority classes. Our approach is simpler, focusing on well-known transformations (log, Yeo-Johnson) for skew and standard SMOTE/ADASYN for imbalance.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
In this project, we built and demonstrated an \textbf{automated} approach to handling two common data-quality challenges: skewed feature distributions and imbalanced classes. By applying statistical detection and transformations for skew, as well as oversampling for minority classes, we observed consistent improvements across four real-world datasets. Our experiments suggest:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Automated transformations help mitigate skewness, boosting many models' performance.
    \item Addressing class imbalance with SMOTE or ADASYN significantly raises minority class recall and F1-scores.
    \item Combining both steps consistently outperforms naive approaches and yields robust gains across multiple datasets.
\end{enumerate}

Future work may explore advanced transformations (e.g., custom expansions, advanced manifold sampling) and cost-sensitive classification. Overall, the pipeline proposed here assists data scientists by automating a critical aspect of data cleaning and rebalancing for improved model performance.
