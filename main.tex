This project focuses on improving the data preprocessing stage of the Data Science (DS) pipeline by automating two critical tasks: (1) correcting skewed feature distributions, and (2) handling imbalanced class distributions. 
First, our system detects numerical features with high skewness and applies an appropriate transformation (e.g., log, square root, or Box-Cox). 
Second, it identifies class imbalance and performs class balancing (e.g., via SMOTE or undersampling). 
We evaluate the proposed method on four datasets: the Medical Appointment No-Show, Telco Customer Churn, Lending Club Loan, and Bank Marketing datasets. 
We compare our approach against a baseline that does not perform any skew handling or class rebalancing. 
Results demonstrate consistent improvements in predictive performance metrics such as F1-score, recall, and precision for minority classes. 
This automation reduces manual effort, mitigates distribution biases, and leads to better-performing machine learning models.

\section{Problem Description}
% 1) What element of the DS pipeline are you trying to improve, and why?
Data preprocessing is a critical element of the DS pipeline and often involves detecting and correcting skewed feature distributions, as well as handling imbalanced class distributions. 
Without proper handling, skewness can bias learned parameters of models (especially linear models), 
while imbalanced classes can degrade a model’s performance on minority classes, leading to suboptimal predictive accuracy. 
However, identifying and handling these issues can be time-consuming and require domain expertise. 
We propose an automated system that streamlines these tasks.

\section{Solution Overview}
% 2) Describe your solution in detail
\subsection{Automated Skewness Detection and Transformation}
Our approach calculates the skewness for each numerical feature. 
If the absolute skewness exceeds a pre-defined threshold (e.g., 1.0), 
we apply a transformation to reduce skew. 
Possible transformations include: \textit{log}, \textit{square root}, and \textit{Box-Cox}, 
chosen automatically based on feature properties (e.g., positivity).

\subsection{Automated Class Balancing}
We detect imbalanced classes by measuring the imbalance ratio. 
For classification tasks, if the ratio of minority to majority class samples falls below a threshold (e.g., 0.2), 
we apply a class-balancing technique. 
Our default approach is SMOTE, 
but we also consider other techniques like random oversampling or random undersampling for comparison.

\subsection{Workflow Integration}
Figure~\ref{fig:workflow} summarizes our pipeline:

    \item Automated Class Imbalance Detection and Balancing
    \item Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
    \item Performance Evaluation
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experimental Evaluation}
% 3) Explain how you prove that your solution “works” and outperform the baselines
\subsection{Datasets}
We experimented with four real-world datasets, each inherently skewed or imbalanced:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Medical Appointment No-Show} \cite{medical_noshow}
    \item \textbf{Telco Customer Churn} \cite{telco_churn}
    \item \textbf{Lending Club Loan Data} \cite{lending_club}
    \item \textbf{Bank Marketing Dataset} \cite{bank_marketing}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Metrics and Baseline}
We compare our method to a \emph{baseline} that uses the raw datasets without any transformation or balancing. 
We focus on classification metrics like F1-score (macro-averaged), Precision, Recall, and Accuracy. 
We also track the distribution metrics such as the average skewness across features.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Train/Test Split: 80/20
    \item Models: Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF)
    \item Repeated 5-fold cross-validation for each setup
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}

Table~\ref{tab:results} shows an example of the improvement we observe after applying our automated pipeline. 
In general, we note around 2-5\% absolute improvement in F1-score and Recall for minority classes. 

\section{Related Work}
% 4) Cite, Discuss existing solutions
Previous works have investigated automated techniques for skew correction and class rebalancing. 
For instance, \textit{(i)} \cite{binary_imbalance} introduced an end-to-end approach for imbalanced data classification, 
\textit{(ii)} \cite{sigaugment} proposed a data augmentation method for low-data imbalanced-class scenarios, 
and \textit{(iii)} \cite{oversampling_investigation} discussed key characteristics of imbalanced data and oversampling methods. 
Our solution leverages similar automated strategies but integrates both skew detection/transformation and class rebalancing in a unified pipeline.

\section{Conclusion}
% 5) Summarize, discuss findings and lessons learned
In this project, we automated two essential preprocessing tasks: skew correction for numerical features and class balancing for imbalanced datasets. 
Our results show that this combined approach can boost model performance on minority classes, while also improving overall distribution properties. 
Future research could explore more advanced transformation methods (e.g., Yeo-Johnson) and adaptive oversampling. 
The lessons learned include the importance of thorough EDA, the value of parameter tuning, and the efficacy of systematic automation in reducing human intervention and errors.
